# Guide

This page will demonstrate how to patch apps using Morphe Manager. 

Morphe Manager has two modes: [Simplified mode](guide.md#simplified-mode) is easy enough for your grandmother to use, while [advanced mode](guide.md#advanced-mode) gives you fine control over Morphe and the patching process, such as allowing you to customize the patch selection.

### Prerequisites

- A device running Android 8 or newer
- The latest version of [Morphe Manager](https://morphe.software/download) installed

## Simplified mode

1. Open Morphe and select the app you want to patch.
2. Follow the prompts to patch an APK of that app.
3. Install the patched APK when it's ready. You can also hit the save button to export the APK. That's all!

## Expert mode
